class Opari2(AutotoolsPackage):
    """OPARI2 is a source-to-source instrumentation tool for OpenMP and hybrid
    codes. It surrounds OpenMP directives and runtime library calls with calls
    to the POMP2 measurement interface. OPARI2 will provide you with a new
    initialization method that allows for multi-directory and parallel builds
    as well as the usage of pre-instrumented libraries. Furthermore, an
    efficient way of tracking parent-child relationships was added.
    Additionally, we extended OPARI2 to support instrumentation of OpenMP 3.0
    tied tasks.
