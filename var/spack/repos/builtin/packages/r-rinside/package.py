class RRinside(RPackage):
    """C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The 'RInside' packages makes
    it easier to have "R inside" your C++ application by providing a C++
    wrapperclass providing the R interpreter. As R itself is embedded into
    your application, a shared library build of R is required. This works on
    Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use the same tools used to
    build R itself. Numerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories
    of the examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, mpi (for
    parallel computing) qt (showing how to embed 'RInside' inside a Qt GUI
    application), wt (showing how to build a "web-application" using the Wt
    toolkit), armadillo (for 'RInside' use with 'RcppArmadillo') and eigen (for
    'RInside' use with 'RcppEigen'). The example use GNUmakefile(s) with GNU
    extensions, so a GNU make is required (and will use the GNUmakefile
    automatically). Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is
    available at the 'RInside' website as well."""
