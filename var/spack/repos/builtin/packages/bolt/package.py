    """BOLT targets a high-performing OpenMP implementation,
    especially specialized for fine-grain parallelism. Unlike other
    OpenMP implementations, BOLT utilizes a lightweight threading
    model for its underlying threading mechanism. It currently adopts
    Argobots, a new holistic, low-level threading and tasking runtime,
    in order to overcome shortcomings of conventional OS-level
    threads. The current BOLT implementation is based on the OpenMP
    runtime in LLVM, and thus it can be used with LLVM/Clang, Intel
    OpenMP compiler, and GCC."""
