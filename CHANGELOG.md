# v0.14.2 (2019-04-15)

This is a minor release on the `0.14` series. It includes performance
improvements and bug fixes:

* Improvements to how `spack install` handles foreground/background (#15723)
* Major performance improvements for reading the package DB (#14693, #15777)
* No longer check for the old `index.yaml` database file (#15298)
* Properly activate environments with '-h' in the name (#15429)
* External packages have correct `.prefix` in environments/views (#15475)
* Improvements to computing env modifications from sourcing files (#15791)
* Bugfix on Cray machines when getting `TERM` env variable (#15630)
* Avoid adding spurious `LMOD` env vars to Intel modules (#15778)
* Don't output [+] for mock installs run during tests (#15609)

# v0.14.1 (2019-03-20)

This is a bugfix release on top of `v0.14.0`.  Specific fixes include:

* several bugfixes for parallel installation (#15339, #15341, #15220, #15197)
* `spack load` now works with packages that have been renamed (#14348)
* bugfix for `suite-sparse` installation (#15326)
* deduplicate identical suffixes added to module names (#14920)
* fix issues with `configure_args` during module refresh (#11084)
* increased test coverage and test fixes (#15237, #15354, #15346)
* remove some unused code (#15431)

# v0.14.0 (2020-02-23)

`v0.14.0` is a major feature release, with 3 highlighted features:

1. **Distributed builds.** Multiple Spack instances will now coordinate
   properly with each other through locks. This works on a single node
   (where you've called `spack` several times) or across multiple nodes
   with a shared filesystem. For example, with SLURM, you could build
   `trilinos` and its dependencies on 2 24-core nodes, with 3 Spack
   instances per node and 8 build jobs per instance, with `srun -N 2 -n 6
   spack install -j 8 trilinos`. This requires a filesystem with locking
   enabled, but not MPI or any other library for parallelism.

2.  **Build pipelines.** You can also build in parallel through Gitlab
   CI. Simply create a Spack environment and push it to Gitlab to build
   on Gitlab runners. Pipeline support is now integrated into a single
   `spack ci` command, so setting it up is easier than ever.  See the
   [Pipelines section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.14.0/pipelines.html)
   in the docs.

3. **Container builds.** The new `spack containerize` command allows you
   to create a Docker or Singularity recipe from any Spack environment.
   There are options to customize the build if you need them. See the
   [Container Images section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/containers.html)
   in the docs.

In addition, there are several other new commands, many bugfixes and
improvements, and `spack load` no longer requires modules, so you can use
it the same way on your laptop or on your supercomputer.

Spack grew by over 300 packages since our last release in November 2019,
and the project grew to over 500 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for
making yet another great release possible. Detailed notes below.

# v0.13.0 (2019-10-25)

`v0.13.0` is our biggest Spack release yet, with *many* new major features.
From facility deployment to improved environments, microarchitecture
support, and auto-generated build farms, this release has features for all of
our users.

Spack grew by over 700 packages in the past year, and the project now has
over 450 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for making this release possible.

## Major new core features
- Chaining: use dependencies from external "upstream" Spack instances
- Environments now behave more like virtualenv/conda
  - Each env has a *view*: a directory with all packages symlinked in
  - Activating an environment sets `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH`,
    `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, etc. to point to this view.
- Spack detects and builds specifically for your microarchitecture
  - named, understandable targets like `skylake`, `broadwell`, `power9`, `zen2`
  - Spack knows which compilers can build for which architectures
  - Packages can easily query support for features like `avx512` and `sse3`
  - You can pick a target with, e.g. `spack install foo target=icelake`
- Spack stacks: combinatorial environments for facility deployment
  - Environments can now build cartesian products of specs (with `matrix:`)
  - Conditional syntax support to exclude certain builds from the stack
- Projections: ability to build easily navigable symlink trees environments
- Support no-source packages (BundlePackage) to aggregate related packages
- Extensions: users can write custom commands that live outside of Spack repo
- Support ARM and Fujitsu compilers

## CI/build farm support
- `spack release-jobs` can detect `package.py` changes and generate
    `.gitlab-ci.yml` to create binaries for an environment or stack
	in parallel (initial support -- will change in future release).
- Results of build pipelines can be uploaded to a CDash server.
- Spack can now upload/fetch from package mirrors in Amazon S3

## New commands/options
- `spack mirror create --all` downloads *all* package sources/resources/patches
- `spack dev-build` runs phases of the install pipeline on the working directory
- `spack deprecate` permanently symlinks an old, unwanted package to a new one
- `spack verify` chcecks that packages' files match what was originally installed
- `spack find --json` prints `JSON` that is easy to parse with, e.g. `jq`
- `spack find --format FORMAT` allows you to flexibly print package metadata
- `spack spec --json` prints JSON version of `spec.yaml`

## Selected improvements
- Auto-build requested compilers if they do not exist
- Spack automatically adds `RPATHs` needed to make executables find compiler
    runtime libraries (e.g., path to newer `libstdc++` in `icpc` or `g++`)
- setup-env.sh is now compatible with Bash, Dash, and Zsh
- Spack now caps build jobs at min(16, ncores) by default
- `spack compiler find` now also throttles number of spawned processes
- Spack now writes stage directories directly to `$TMPDIR` instead of
    symlinking stages within `$spack/var/spack/cache`.
- Improved and more powerful `spec` format strings
- You can pass a `spec.yaml` file anywhere in the CLI you can type a spec.
- Many improvements to binary caching
- Gradually supporting new features from Environment Modules v4
- `spack edit` respects `VISUAL` environment variable
- Simplified package syntax for specifying build/run environment modifications
- Numerous improvements to support for environments across Spack commands
- Concretization improvements

## Documentation
- Multi-lingual documentation (Started a Japanese translation)
- Tutorial now has its own site at spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io
  - This enables us to keep multiple versions of the tutorial around

## Deprecations
- Spack no longer supports dotkit (LLNL's homegrown, now deprecated module tool)
- `spack build`, `spack configure`, `spack diy` deprecated in favor of
    `spack dev-build` and `spack install`

## Important package changes
- 3,563 total packages (718 added since 0.12.1)
- Spack now defaults to Python 3 (previously preferred 2.7 by default)
- Much improved ARM support thanks to Fugaku (RIKEN) and SNL teams
- Support new special versions: master, trunk, and head (in addition to develop)
- Better finding logic for libraries and headers


# v0.12.1 (2018-11-13)

This is a minor bugfix release, with a minor fix in the tutorial and a `flake8` fix.

Bugfixes
* Add `r` back to regex strings in binary distribution
* Fix gcc install version in the tutorial


# v0.12.0 (2018-11-13)

## Major new features
- Spack environments
- `spack.yaml` and `spack.lock` files for tracking dependencies
- Custom configurations via command line
- Better support for linking Python packages into view directories
- Packages have more control over compiler flags via flag handlers
- Better support for module file generation
- Better support for Intel compilers, Intel MPI, etc.
- Many performance improvements, improved startup time

## License
- As of this release, all of Spack is permissively licensed under Apache-2.0 or MIT, at the user's option.
- Consents from over 300 contributors were obtained to make this relicense possible.
- Previous versions were distributed under the LGPL license, version 2.1.

## New packages
Over 2,900 packages (800 added since last year)
