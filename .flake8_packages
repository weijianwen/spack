# flake8 settings for Spack package files.
#
# This should include all the same exceptions that we use for core files.
#
# In Spack packages, we also allow the single `from spack import *`
# wildcard import and dependencies can set globals for their
# dependents. So we add exceptions for checks related to undefined names.
#
# Note that we also add *per-line* exemptions for certain patterns in the
# `spack flake8` command.  This is where F403 for `from spack import *`
# is added (beause we *only* allow that wildcard).
#
# See .flake8 for regular exceptions.
#
# F4: Import
# - F405: `name` may be undefined, or undefined from star imports: `module`
#
# F8: Name
# - F821: undefined name `name`
#
